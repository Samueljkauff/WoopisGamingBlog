            <h2 class="name">Lengend of Zelda Breath of the Wild</h2>
               <img src="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/06/14/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-1655249167687.jpg" class="gamingphotos">
                <p class="para"> Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild is an  excellent game. This is arguably one of the best Nintendo Switch games to release, if not the best. As a huge Legend of Zelda fan I already gravitated towards this game but honestly wasn't really thrilled on the open world aspect, thinking it would draw away from the Legend of Zelda vide that we have all grown to love and enjoy. I was right. It really doesn't feel like a Legend game while you're wondering the wilderness and taking on camps of Bokoblins.</p>
                <p class="para">Although the wilderness and the open world doesn't feel like a Zelda game, as soon as I entered a shrine that Zelda feeling was back. The feeling of knowing the puzzle is right at the tip of your finger but you can't quite get that door to open and the satisfaction of finally figuring it out. Hearing that soft rhythm play as the dooor finally opens and you can finally get another heart container or stamina.</p>
                <p class="para">I grew to love this game after the first couple of shrines and any sour taste I had in my mouth before playing was gone. I do think this is a better open world game than a Zelda game. It's obviously still an amazing game as all Legend od Zelda games are, I give this game a 8/10 on the Woopi scale. I hope this review helped and keep gaming!</p>
            
            <h2 class="name">Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege</h2>
                <img src="https://store.ubi.com/dw/image/v2/ABBS_PRD/on/demandware.static/-/Sites-masterCatalog/default/dw96e74d63/images/large/56c494ad88a7e300458b4d5a.jpg?sw=341&sh=450&sm=fit" class="gamingphotos">
                <p class="para"> Even though I've never been into shooter games, Rainbow Six Siege is an exception. I've always found this game so interesting and I could never figure out why. Maybe it was the unique operators or maybe it was the drones and cameras. Whatever it is, I absolutely love it. this game is by far the best shooter game I have ever played and I truely believe it is one of the greatest and most revolutionary game ever made.</p>
                <p class="para">Ever since I satrted playing this game, I've found it abnormally hard and the players were always so good. This only motivated me to play more and get better. From the alpha pack system, to the wall bangs, this game always had me coming back. What I think makes the game so unique and o different from others, is there are so many ways you can attack and defend a building. All the unique operators, gadgets, and guns I couldn't get enough.</p>
                <p class="para">The worst part of this game is its community and player base. There are so many toxic players but you can't have a competitive shooter game without toxicity. I also do think Ubisoft (the developers of Siege) tries to update the game and change it according on how they want you to play it, not how the players play it. I give this game a 9/10 on the Woopi scale. I hope this review helped and keep gaming! </p>
            
            <h2 class="name">Pokemon Sword and Shield</h2>
                <img src="https://tuftsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pokemon-919x1024.jpg" class="gamingphotos">
                <p class="para">Pokemon Sword and Shield was a game that I was so excited to release, as like most Pokemon games. When it did release I bought Shield because I liked the exclusive pokemon more in it more than shield. In my opinion they're both have great exclusive pokemon. I was a little disappointed on the two main legendaries. I thought they looked sort of dumb and not really that unique.</p>
                <p class="para">I went into this game with pretty average expectations for a traditional Pokemon game. I came out of the game with a pretty average experience. I didn't think any of the features were ground breaking and didn't find Dynamaxing Pokemon that cool. It was a pretty traditional Pokemon game adn that's fine. The gym challenges were very easy to beat and they only one that really gave me a challenge was the fairy gym. I had about 25 hours of time on the game when I won the champion cup.</p>
                <p class="para">This game was a good pokemon game but there wasn't really anything that stood out compared to the others. Of course this didn't sour my taste for Pokemon and I'm still going to pick up the next one that comes out and the one after that. I give this game a 5/10 on the Woopi scale. I hope this review helped and keep gaming!</p>
