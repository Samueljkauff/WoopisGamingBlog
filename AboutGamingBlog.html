            <h2>Who is Woopi and why does he have a Gaming blog?</h2>
            <p class="second">Woopi: "I am a gamer from the United States who has a passion for gaming and video game culture. One day while I was tying to find a good review on a game I was interested in, I noticed there are very few non-bias reviews on the internet. At the time I was learning how to use html and css and decided that I would make a site for Gamers with reliable game reviews. I am happy to be here to provide reviews for you. enjoy!" </p>

            <h4>What is your favorite FPS game?</h4>
            <p class="qaap">"Honestly the only FPS game I really really got into is Rainbow Six Siege. In my opinion I think it's one of the best shooter games ever made and by far my favorite FPS game."</p>
            <h4>What is your favorite Nintendo game?</h4>
            <p class="qaap">"I've always been a huge fan of the Legend of Zelda franchise ever since I was a kid. I'd say my all time favorite Nintendo game is Legend of Zelda Majora's Mask 3D." </p>
            <h4>What is your favorite Pokemon game?</h4>
            <p class="qaap">"This is a tricky one because I went into Pokemon Legends Arceus with loew expectations but I ended up absolutely loving it! I also don't believe it's a tradition Pokemon game. So I'd say Pokemon Y is my all time favorite Pokemon game."</p>
